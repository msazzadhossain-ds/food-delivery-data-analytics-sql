### Overview: 
This project focuses on analyzing the operations and performance of a food delivery company using SQL. A relational database was designed and implemented to store key information about customers, riders, restaurants, orders, menu items, cities, etc. By leveraging SQL, the project extracted actionable insights from the data to address real-world business challenges, optimize decision-making, and enhance operational efficiency.

### Objective: 
Utilize SQL to solve critical business questions and translate data findings into meaningful insights that can support strategic decisions and operational improvements.

### Steps: 
1. Create a database named food_delivery
2. Insert datasets (12 tables) in MySQL
3. Necessary data processing & transformation
4. Answer questions (writing queries) & insights

### Queries Answered: 
1.	Retrieve a list of user information with their name and date of registration who uses android phones.
2.	Find out users who have registered on or after 14th of july and sort the list of users in ascending order.
3.	Retrieve a list of all restaurants and their menu items. Some restaurants may not have any menu items yet.
4.	Extend the previous result to include the restaurant's contact number and the availability status of each menu item. If a restaurant does not have any menu items, display "No Menu Items" in the menu item column.
5.	Retrieve the total number of orders placed by each user. Sort the results in descending order based on the number of orders.
6.	Find the average price of menu items for each restaurant. Sort the results in ascending order based on the restaurant name.
7.	Identify the restaurant with the highest total sales (sum of order amounts). Display the restaurant name and the total sales amount.
8.	Find the number of orders placed in each city. Sort the results in descending order based on the number of orders.
9.	Find the names of restaurants that have at least one menu item with a price greater than $10.
10.	Retrieve the user names and their corresponding orders where the order total is greater than the average order total for all users.
11.	List the names of users whose last names start with 'S' or ends with 'e'.
12.	Find the total order amounts for each restaurant. If a restaurant has no orders, display the restaurant name and a total amount of 0.
13.	Find out how many orders were placed using cash or credit.

### Key Highlights:
